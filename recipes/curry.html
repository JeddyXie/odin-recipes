    <h3>Steps to Make our Dumps!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” 
                we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.</li>
            <li>Cut the onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into 
                thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.</li>
            <li>DPeel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). 
                This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 
                15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
